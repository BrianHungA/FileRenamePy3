# file_renamed_py3 API
## This API is a tiny tool to help rename a large amount of files with python 3.
- Here's several steps as a tutorial:
  1. Download the package including API, demo_code, and test data and put them in the same file path.
  2. Run the demo_code.
  3. You need to input the file path and the "Source Csv File" made by you.
  (or you can just use the test data and test csv file)
